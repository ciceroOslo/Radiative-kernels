# Radiative-kernels
Netcdf files containing data for radiative kernels. 

## Ozone kernel data

3D-fields with normalized radiative forcing values for gases and aerosols.

* The file NFRO3v6_OsloRF.nc contains radiative kernel data for ozone.

The data are documented in the article [Skeie et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-020-00131-0)

## PDRMIP kernel data

* The file pdrmip_toa_rtkv2_albedo_T42_monthly.nc include radiative effects from surface albedo changes, and pdrmip_atm_rtkv2_albedo_T42_monthly.nc is the atmospheric radiative heating kernel for the same.

* The file pdrmip_toa_rtkv2_surfdT_T42_monthly.nc include radiative effects from surface temperature changes, and pdrmip_atm_rtkv2_surfdT_T42_monthly.nc is the atmospheric radiative heating kernel for the same.

* The file pdrmip_toa_rtkv2_vertdT_T42L60_monthly.nc include radiative effects from atmospheric temperature changes, and pdrmip_atm_rtkv2_vertdT_T42L60_monthly.nc is the atmospheric radiative heating kernel for the same.

These data are documented in the article [Myhre et al. 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GL079474)
